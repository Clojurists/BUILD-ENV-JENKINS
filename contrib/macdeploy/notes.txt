macdeployqtplus works best on OS X Lion, for Snow Leopard you'd need to install
Python 2.7 and make it your default Python installation.

You will need the appscript package for the fancy disk image creation to work.
Install it by invoking "sudo easy_install appscript".

Ths script should be invoked in the target directory like this:
$source_dir/contrib/macdeploy/macdeployqtplus NovaCoin-Qt.app -add-qt-tr da,de,es,hu,ru,uk,zh_CN,zh_TW -dmg -fancy $source_dir/contrib/macdeploy/fancy.plist -verbose 2
